# Dice Roll
## Summary
This is the recreation of the 'Pig's Game' using HTML5, JavaScript, CSS and jQuery.

Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish,
adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

Pig often serves as a simple example for teaching probability concepts from the middle school level upwards. The game also provides exercises for teaching Computer Science in areas ranging from introductory courses to advanced machine learning material.
