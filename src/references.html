            <p id="rules">Basic JS based Dice Game Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":If the player rolls a 1,
            they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
            If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to score 20 or more points wins.</p>

            <h3 id="idea-title">Idea:</h3>
            <p id="idea">I had the idea for this specific game from one Udemy HTML/CSS course i attended 2-3 years ago but I didn't finish this project at that time, so I thought
                it would be a great idea to do it right now. The original game is called something like "Pig's game" or "The game of Pig" (I am not sure). Of course, I had to add some
                additional things so my project fulfils all the requirements.

            <p id="pictures">All the pictures I included in this program (background picture and dice sides pictures) were taken from Google Photos. I got to them by just typing
                 'dice pictures' in Google search bar.</p>

        <div class="rest">
            <h3 id="rest-title">The rest:</h3>
            <p id="rest">The only code I borrowed from Internet was an algorithm for sorting a table by columns (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sort_table.asp). All the
                rest was taken from previous lab exercises (table insertion and deletion) or from stack overflow.
